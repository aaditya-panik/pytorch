## Senior Engineer's Guide: Understanding PyTorch Step-by-Step

*A structured approach to understanding the PyTorch codebase for new engineers*

### Phase 1: Foundation Understanding (Week 1-2)

#### Start Here - Get the Big Picture
1. **Read the README.md** - Understand what PyTorch is and why it exists
2. **Explore the high-level structure** - Don't dive deep yet, just understand the major directories
3. **Run a simple example** - Create a basic tensor, do some operations, see it work
4. **Understand the core problem** - PyTorch solves tensor computation + automatic differentiation

#### Key Concepts to Grasp First
- **Tensors** - The fundamental data structure (like NumPy arrays but GPU-capable)
- **Autograd** - Automatic differentiation for gradient computation
- **Dynamic Graphs** - Computation graphs built on-the-fly vs. static graphs
- **Device Abstraction** - CPU, CUDA, MPS backends

#### Recommended Reading Order
1. `README.md` - Project overview
2. `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Development practices (sections 1-3)
3. `torch/` directory overview - Don't read code yet, just understand structure
4. Basic PyTorch tutorial (external) - Get hands-on experience

### Phase 2: Core Architecture Deep Dive (Week 3-4)

#### Follow the Data Flow
Understanding PyTorch means following how data (tensors) flow through the system:

```
Python Code (torch.tensor([1, 2, 3]))
    ↓
Python Bindings (torch/csrc/)
    ↓
C++ Tensor Library (aten/)
    ↓
Core Infrastructure (c10/)
    ↓
Hardware Backend (CUDA/CPU kernels)
```

#### Start with C10 - The Foundation
- **Location**: `c10/` directory
- **What to look for**:
  - `c10/core/TensorImpl.h` - How tensors are actually represented
  - `c10/core/DeviceType.h` - Device abstraction
  - `c10/util/` - Basic utilities used everywhere
- **Key insight**: c10 is the "standard library" for PyTorch

#### Move to ATen - Tensor Operations
- **Location**: `aten/src/ATen/`
- **What to look for**:
  - `aten/src/ATen/Tensor.h` - The main Tensor class
  - `aten/src/ATen/native/` - Where operators are implemented
  - `aten/src/ATen/ops/` - Generated operator declarations
- **Key insight**: ATen is "A Tensor Library" - pure tensor operations without autograd

#### Explore the Dispatch System
- **Location**: `aten/src/ATen/core/dispatch/`
- **What to understand**:
  - How operators are dispatched to different backends
  - Why this design enables multiple backends (CPU, CUDA, MPS)
  - Example: Follow `torch.add` from Python to actual implementation

### Phase 3: Python Integration (Week 5-6)

#### Python Bindings Deep Dive
- **Location**: `torch/csrc/`

  - `torch/csrc/autograd/function.cpp` - Function nodes in computation graph
  - `torch/csrc/autograd/variable.cpp` - Tensors with gradient tracking
- **Key insight**: Autograd builds a computation graph backwards from outputs

#### Study a Complete Example
Pick a simple operation like `torch.add` and trace it through:
1. Python call in `torch/add.py`
2. C++ binding in `torch/csrc/`
3. Dispatch to ATen operation
4. Actual implementation in `aten/src/ATen/native/`
5. Autograd backward pass definition

### Phase 5: Build System & Code Generation (Week 9-10)

#### Understanding the Build
- **Files to study**:
  - `setup.py` - Main build configuration

### Debugging & Development Workflow

#### Essential Tools
1. **GDB/LLDB** - For C++ debugging
2. **PyTorch Profiler** - For performance analysis
3. **pytest** - For selective testing
4. **Build in debug mode** - Use `DEBUG=1` environment variable

#### Common Debugging Patterns
1. **Python stack traces** - Usually lead to C++ code
2. **Dispatch tracing** - Use `TORCH_SHOW_DISPATCH_TRACE=1`
3. **Memory debugging** - Use sanitizers in debug builds

#### Development Best Practices
1. **Start small** - Make minimal changes first
2. **Test thoroughly** - Run relevant tests before and after changes
3. **Follow patterns** - Look at similar existing implementations
4. **Ask questions** - The codebase is complex, use the community

### Key Mental Models

#### 1. Layered Architecture
Think of PyTorch as an onion:
- **Python API** - User-friendly interface
- **C++ Bindings** - Performance bridge
- **ATen** - Tensor operations
- **c10** - Core infrastructure
- **Hardware** - Actual computation

#### 2. Dispatch as a Router
The dispatch system is like a smart router that sends operations to the right backend based on tensor properties.

#### 3. Autograd as a Graph Builder
Autograd doesn't compute gradients immediately - it builds a graph of operations that can be traversed backward.

#### 4. Code Generation as Scalability
With 1000+ operators and multiple backends, hand-writing everything is impossible. Code generation ensures consistency and maintainability.

### Common Pitfalls for New Engineers

1. **Diving too deep too fast** - Start with the big picture
2. **Ignoring the build system** - Understanding builds is crucial
3. **Not using debugging tools** - Learn GDB/LLDB early
4. **Focusing only on Python** - The real work happens in C++
5. **Not understanding dispatch** - This is key to PyTorch's flexibility
